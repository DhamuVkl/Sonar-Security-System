**The Sonar Security System (SSS)** is an innovative application of sonar technology for dynamic environment mapping. Instead of conventional radio waves, this system employs sound waves to create a detailed graphical representation of the surroundings, akin to a ship's radar monitor. 

## Key Features

* **Security Surveillance:** The SSS offers real-time dynamic mapping, making it a valuable tool in security systems for comprehensive surveillance.

* **Environmental Monitoring:** Beyond security, the system finds applications in environmental monitoring, providing detailed layouts of areas of interest.

* **Assistive Technology for the Visually Impaired:** The adaptability of this technology allows for its use as an assistive device, furnishing precise environmental information to visually impaired individuals, enhancing their spatial awareness.

* **Adaptability to Various Domains:** The SSS technology demonstrates versatility, finding applications in diverse fields, ranging from security and environmental monitoring to assistive devices for the visually impaired.


## Technologies Used

<img align="right" alt="coding" width="300" src="https://dharageshtech.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/radar.jpg?strip=info&w=900">

* **Sonar Sensor (HC-04):** This fundamental component emits and receives sound waves, allowing precise distance measurements within the surrounding environment.

* **Servo Motor:** The servo motor is integral to the project, enabling controlled rotation of the sonar sensor. This rotation facilitates measurements at various angles, leading to a comprehensive environmental map.

* **Arduino Uno (ATmega328p):** The Arduino Uno microcontroller serves as the project's brain, responsible for managing the servo motor and collecting sonar sensor data. It further processes this data to calculate distances at different rotation angles.

* **Processing3 Software:** A critical element in the project, Processing3 serves as the intermediary between the collected sonar data and the graphical representation of the environment. It interprets the data and translates it into a visual format reminiscent of a ship's radar monitor.
